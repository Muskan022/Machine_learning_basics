    "Ans - 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. It involves creating algorithms and systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and learning from experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A chatbot that can have a natural language conversation with users, providing information, answering questions, and even engaging in small talk, is an example of AI. These chatbots use AI algorithms to understand the user's input, process it, and generate appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve their performance on a task through experience. In other words, instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a specific task, a machine learning system learns from data and adapts its behavior over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a spam email filter. Instead of being given explicit rules for what constitutes spam, a machine learning algorithm can be trained on a dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam). The algorithm learns to recognize patterns and characteristics in the data that differentiate between the two. Once trained, it can classify new, unseen emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain's neural structure to process data and extract meaningful patterns. Deep Learning has shown remarkable success in tasks such as image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Image recognition is a common application of deep learning. A deep neural network can be trained to recognize objects within images. For instance, a deep learning model can be trained on thousands of images of cats and dogs, learning to automatically distinguish between the two based on features it extracts from the images. This kind of model could then identify whether an image contains a cat or a dog with high accuracy.\n",
